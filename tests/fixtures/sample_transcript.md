# Meeting Transcript

**Alice**: Hello everyone, let's get started with today's meeting.

**Bob**: Thanks Alice. I wanted to discuss the Q4 roadmap first.

**Alice**: Great. We have three main priorities this quarter:
1. Complete the budget review by end of November
2. Launch the new product features in December  
3. Finalize team restructuring plans

**Bob**: The budget looks good so far. We're tracking slightly under our projections.

**Alice**: That's excellent news. Let's schedule a follow-up for next week.

**Bob**: Sounds good. I'll send out the calendar invite.

**Alice**: Thanks everyone. Meeting adjourned.
